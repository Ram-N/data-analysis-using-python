Annual Estimates of the Resident Population:  April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012

Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 
population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. See 
Geographic Terms and Definitions at  
http://www.census.gov/popest/about/geo/terms.html for a list of the states that are included 
in each region and division. All geographic boundaries for the 2012 population estimates series 
are defined as of January 1, 2012. An "(X)" in the 2010 Census field indicates a locality that 
was formed or incorporated after the 2010 Census. Additional information on these localities can 
be found in the Geographic Change Notes (see  
http://www.census.gov/popest/about/geo/changes.html). For population estimates methodology 
statements, see
