Notes: 
Crude oil import prices come from the IEA's Crude Oil Import Register 
and are influenced not only by traditional movements of supply and 
demand, but also by other factors such as geopolitics. Information 
is collected from national agencies according to the type of crude 
oil, by geographic origin and by quality of crude. Average prices 
are obtained by dividing value by volume as recorded by customs 
administrations for each tariff position. Values are recorded at 
the time of import and include cost, insurance and freight, but 
exclude import duties. The nominal crude oil spot price from 2003 
to 2011 is for Dubai and from 1970 to 2002 for Arabian Light. This 
indicator is measured in USD per barrel of oil. The real price was 
calculated using the deflator for GDP at market prices and rebased 
with reference year 1970 = 100.
